# maze generator
This is an implementation of [maze generation algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm) in Unity which I made for fun.

This project and it's assets are far (but close enough) from perfect, but it works so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

The 'current' and 'been' prefabs were made for only debugging purpose and are not required for the project to work.

### have fun
